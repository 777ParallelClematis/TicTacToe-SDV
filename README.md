# TicTacToe-SDV
This is my TicTacToe project for SDV


Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game with a 3x3 board. 
One player is assigned to place X's and the other O's. 
Players take turns placing their symbol in attempt to make 3 in a row on the board. 
This can be done horizontally, diagonally or vertically. 
When one of the players makes 3-in-a-row, the player wins and this game is over. 

This game is played entirely in the terminal, displaying the 3x3 board, its iterations, instructions. 
This game requires the node.js download, as it uses Readline to enable User Input. 
If node is installed, calling the function "node TicTacToe.js" (case sensitive) will cause the game to start. 

This game is played from one file, named TicTacToe.js.
